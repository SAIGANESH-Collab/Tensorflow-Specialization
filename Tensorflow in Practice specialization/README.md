# Tensorflow Speicialization

__________________

* Course provided at [Coursera]([cour](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?)) as part of [deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai).
* All materials added here are for my own learning purpose.
* Do not use this repository as means of copy-pasting answers, take your time in completing the quiz and notebooks on your own.
* Concepts taught are pretty well.
* Coures are more hands-on, it's recommended to first learn the basic fundamental of Deep learning and neural network architectures first then follow this course.
